# AMD OpenNIC Shell

This is one of the three components of the
[OpenNIC project](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic.git).  The other components are: 
- [OpenNIC driver](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic-driver.git) and
- [OpenNIC DPDK](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic-dpdk.git).

OpenNIC shell delivers an FPGA-based NIC shell with 100Gbps Ethernet ports.  The
latest version is built with Vivado 2020.x, 2021.x or 2022.1.  Currently, the supported boards include:

- Xilinx Alveo U50, and
- Xilinx Alveo U55N, and
- Xilinx Alveo U55C, and
- Xilinx Alveo U200, and
- Xilinx Alveo U250, and
- Xilinx Alveo U280, and
- Xilinx Alveo U45N

| Notes: |
|:---|
|* In the Alveo U50 version only, Vivado may issue critical warnings regarding the power margin for the MGTYAVtt with respect to a margin on the 4A rail limit. While the U50's open-nic-shell MGT current (~3.97A) is still slightly below the rail's limit, this will go outside of the 10% margin described in the U50 board files.  The U50 version has worked in a lab setting but with minimal testing.  While this issue is considered to have low risk, please be aware of this condition and proceed if that risk is acceptable.
|* Vivado 2022.2 uses QDMA v5.0. Driver may need to be upgraded to support QDMA 5.0.
|* Also, starting from OpenNIC 1.0, the support for Bittware SoC-250 is obsolete and no longer maintained.


The NIC shell consists of skeleton components which implement host and Ethernet
interfaces and two user logic boxes that wraps up user RTL plugins.  Its
architecture is shown in the figure below.

                 AXI4-stream 250MHz  AXI4-stream 322MHz

The shell skeleton has the following components.

- QDMA subsystem.  It includes the Xilinx QDMA IP and RTL logic that bridges the
  QDMA IP interface and the 250MHz user logic box.  The interfaces between QDMA
  subsystem and the 250MHz box use a variant of the AXI4-stream protocol.  Let
  us refer the variant as the 250MHz AXI4-stream.
  > - U45N has two QDMA subsystems. One for the host CPU, another 
  	for onboard Arm CPU. Two sets of AXI4-stream interfaces between QDMA
	subsystems and the 250MHz box.
- CMAC subsystem.  It includes the Xilinx CMAC IP and some wrapper logic.
  OpenNIC shell supports either 1 or 2 CMAC ports.  In the case of 2 CMAC ports,
  there are two instances of CMAC subsystems with dedicated data and control
  interfaces.  The CMAC subsystem runs at 322MHz and connects to the 322MHz user
  logic box using a variant of the AXI4-stream protocol.  Similarly, let us
  refer the variant as the 322MHz AXI4-stream.
- Packet adapter.  It is used to convert between the 250MHz AXI4-stream and
  322MHz AXI4-stream.  On both TX and RX paths, the packet adapter serves as a
  packet-mode FIFO, which buffers the whole packet before sending out.  On the
  RX path, it also restores the back-pressure capability which is missing from
  the CMAC subsystem interface.
- System configuration.  It implements a reset mechanism and allocates the
  register addresses for each components.  The register interface uses AXI4-lite
  protocol and runs at 125MHz, which is phase-aligned with the 25MHz clock.

There are 2 user logic boxes, one running at 250MHz and the other at 322MHz.
Each has a AXI-lite interface for register, 2 pairs of slave and master
AXI4-stream interfaces for TX and RX respectively.  User RTL plugins are
responsible for implementing the handling of these interfaces.

Most of the directories are self-explanatory.  The code under `src` contains the
skeleton components and the "empty" boxes.  Sample plugins are available under
the `plugin` directory.

## How to Build

OpenNIC shell is built by running the Tcl script `build.tcl` under `script` in
Vivado.  Depending on the target device, the build script generates proper files
for flash programming.

It is recommended to build the design with Internet connection, as it relies on
updated Xilinx board files, accessible through [Xilinx Board
Store](https://github.com/Xilinx/XilinxBoardStore).  The build script
automatically updates Vivado against this repository.  See the below section for
build without Internet/Github access.

### Build Script Options

To start building the shell, run the following command under `script` with a
proper `MODE` choice (i.e., `tcl`, `batch` or `gui`).

    vivado -mode MODE -source build.tcl -tclargs [-OPTION VALUE] ...

A list of options are available to configure the build process and customize
the design parameters.

    # Build options

    -board_repo  PATH
                 path to local Xilinx board store repository for offline build.
                 This option is used when Vivado is unable to connect to github
                 and update the board repository.

    -board       BOARD_NAME
                 supported boards include:
                 - au250, and
                 - au280, and
                 - au200, and
                 - au55c, and
                 - au55n, and
                 - au50,  and
				 - U45N.

    -tag         DESIGN_TAG
                 string to identify the build.  The tag, along with the board
                 name, becomes part of the build directory name.

    -overwrite   0 (default), 1
                 indicate if the script should overwrite existing build results.

    -jobs        [1, 32] (default to 8)
                 number of jobs for synthesis and implementation.

    -synth_ip    0, 1 (default)
                 indicate if IPs are out-of-box synthesized after creation.

    -impl        0 (default), 1
                 indicate if the script runs towards bitstream generation.  If
                 set to 0, the script only creates the project and do not launch
                 any run.

    -post_impl   0 (default), 1
                 indicate if MCS file is generated after bitstream generations.

    -user_plugin PATH
                 path to the user plugin repository.

    # Design parameters

    -build_timestamp VALUE
                     VALUE should be an 8-digit hexdecimal value without prefix.
                     It serves as the timestamp to identify the build and is
                     written into the shell register 0x0.  If not specified, the
                     date and time of the build is recorded using the format
                     MMDDhhmm, where MM is for month, DD for day, hh for hour
                     and mm for minute.

    -min_pkt_len     [64, 256] (default to 64)
                     minimum packet length.

    -max_pkt_len     [256, 9600] (default to 1514)
                     maximum packet length.

    -use_phys_func   0, 1 (default)
                     indicates if the QDMA H2C and C2H AXI4-stream interfaces are
                     included in the 250MHz user logic box.  A common scenario
                     for not using them is networking accelerators without DMA.
                     Regardless the value of this option, the QDMA IP is always
                     present in the shell since it also provide the AXI-lite
                     interfaces for register access.

    -num_phys_func   [1, 4] (default to 1)
                     number of QDMA physical functions per QDMA subsystem.

    -num_qdma        1 (default), 2
                     number of QDMA subsystems, subjects to the board model.

    -num_queue       [1, 2048] (default to 512)
                     number of QDMA queues.

    -num_cmac_port   1 (default), 2
                     number of CMAC ports, subjects to the board model.

### Build Process

The build process involves four steps.

1. IP creation and optionally, out-of-box synthesis.
2. Design project setup.
3. Synthesis, implementation and bitstream generation.
4. Post-processing.

By default, the script completes the first two steps, producing a Vivado project
under the build directory.  This can be customized using the `-synth_ip`,
`-impl` and `-post_impl` options.

- If `-synth_ip` is set to 0, the IP out-of-box synthesis is deferred.
- If `-impl` is set to 1, the third step is performed.
- If `-post_impl` is set 1, the post-processing step is performed after
  bitstream generation.

The build directory is located under `build` and named as `[BOARD]_[TAG]`.
Under the build directory, there is a text file, `DESIGN_PARAMETERS`, which
contains the parameters passed to the RTL top-level.  All the IP files are
stored under `vivado_ip`.  The shell project is under `open_nic_shell`.

The following Verilog macros are defined and made available to the RTL source
code.

- The `__synthesis__` macro.
- Board name, either `__au250__`, `__au280__`, `__au50__`, `__au55c__`, `__au55n__` or `__au45n__`.

### Build without Github Access from Vivado

If Vivado does not have access to Github, we need to have a local copy of the
[Xilinx Board Store](https://github.com/Xilinx/XilinxBoardStore) repository, and
pass the path to the build script via the `-board_repo` option.

## User Plugin Integration

OpenNIC shell provides 2 user logic boxes for instantiating custom RTL logic,
one running at 250MHz and the other at 322MHz.  To build with custom plugins,
pass the path of the plugin repository to the `-user_plugin` argument of the
build script.  Default plugins are available for both boxes under
`plugin/p2p/box_250mhz` and `plugin/p2p/box_322mhz` respectively, which does
simple port-to-port connection.  If users are interested in only one box, they
should instantiate the default plugin in the other one.

Each box requires a top-level wrapper for all the user plugins instantiated in
that box.  In other words, only one module should be instantiated in each box.
There are a few rules on how to structure the `-user_plugin`.  At a minimum
level, it should look like the following.

    |-- USER_PLUGIN_DIR --
        |-- box_250mhz --
            |-- user_plugin_250mhz_inst.vh
            |-- box_250mhz_address_map_inst.vh
            |-- box_250mhz_address_map.v
            |-- box_250mhz_axi_crossbar.tcl
        |-- box_322mhz --
            |-- user_plugin_322mhz_inst.vh
            |-- box_322mhz_address_map_inst.vh
            |-- box_322mhz_address_map.v
            |-- box_322mhz_axi_crossbar.tcl
        |-- ... --
        |-- build_box_250mhz.tcl
        |-- build_box_322mhz.tcl
        |-- ...

The files under `box_250mhz` and `box_322mhz` are glue code that connects the
user plugins to OpenNIC shell.

- `user_plugin_XXXmhz_inst.vh` is a Verilog header file that instantiates the
  top-level wrapper.  It is included into `src/box_XXXmhz/box_XXXmhz.sv`.
- `box_XXXmhz_address_map_inst.vh` is a Verilog header file that instantiates
  the `box_XXXmhz_address_map` module.  It is included into
  `src/box_XXXmhz/box_XXXmhz.sv`.
- `box_XXXmhz_address_map.v` implements the register address mapping in
  `box_XXXmhz`.
- `box_XXXmhz_axi_crossbar.tcl` creates the AXI crossbar IP instantiated in
  `box_XXXmhz_address_map.v`.

Currently, these files need to be created and modified manually.  In the next
release, they will be auto-generated through a configuration file.

For each box, the build script performs the following steps.

1. Source `box_XXXmhz_axi_crossbar.tcl`.
2. Read `box_XXXmhz_address_map.v`.
3. Add `USER_PLUGIN_DIR/box_XXXmhz` to the `include_dirs` property.
4. Source `build_box_XXXmhz.tcl`.

To use the default plugin (i.e., `plugin/p2p`) in one of the boxes, remove the
corresponding `box_XXXmhz` directory and `build_box_XXXmhz.tcl`.

When the design is configured with two QDMA subsystems, two sets of AXI4-stream 
interfaces are provided to box_250MHz. The default p2p plugin of box_250MHz has 
one ingress switch and one egress switch per QDMA physical function. For example, 
P2P plugin of U45N has totaly four AXI4-stream switches. To select the data 
path between MAC and two QDMA subsystems, AXI4-stream switch control registers
are used. The user can select one QDMA subsystem to be used exclusively for 
transmitting or receiving traffic. Please refer to [AXI4-Stream Switch Control 
Register](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/pg085-axi4stream-infrastructure/Control-Register) 
of PG085 for more details.

For example:

Data path: MAC <-> QDMA subsystem 0 (On U45N, it is connected to host CPU)
Select QDMA subsystem 0:
```bash
# BDF is the bus ID of first physical function of QDMA's
bdf=<PCIe BDF> #e.g. d9
# Ingress port 0
pcimem /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:${bdf}\:00.0/resource2 0x100040 w*1 0

```

## Shell Interface

Shell and user logic boxes communicates through 3 types of interfaces.

- AXI-lite interface running at 125MHz for register access.
- AXI4-stream interface running at either 250MHz or 322MHz for data path.
- Synchronous reset interface running at 125MHz.

The 125MHz and 250MHz clock domains are phase aligned.  Signals can be sampled
across each domain without clock domain crossing.  On the other hand, do note
that different clock frequencies can lead to double sampling or missing samples.

The AXI-lite interface follows the standard AXI4-lite protocol without `wstrb`,
`awprot` and `arprot`.  At the system level, the address ranges for the 2 boxes
are

- 0x100000 - 0x1FFFFF for the 250MHz box, and
- 0x200000 - 0x2FFFFF for the 322MHz box.

The 250MHz and 322MHz AXI4-stream interfaces have slightly different semantics.
The 250MHz interface has the following signals.

- `tvalid`, 1 bit: same as standard AXI4-stream protocol.
- `tdata`, 512 bits: data maps from lower to upper bytes.
- `tkeep`, 64 bits: null bytes are only allowed when both `tvalid` and `tlast`
  are asserted and cannot be followed by other data bytes for the same packet.
  For example, a 96B packet has a `tkeep` value of 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF in the
  first beat, and 0x00000000FFFFFFFF in the second beat.
- `tlast`, 1 bit: same as standard AXI4-stream protocol.
- `tuser_size`, 16 bits: field to specify packet size.  It contains the number
  of bytes in the packet and must remain valid and unchanged if `tvalid` is
  asserted.
- `tuser_src`, 16 bits: source of the packet.
- `tuser_dst`, 16 bits: destination of the packet.
- `tuser_user`, N bits: side-band user data.
- `tready`, 1 bit: same as standard AXI4-stream protocol.

For the `tkeep` signal, the interface assumes its presence depending on the
direction of a packet.

- For packets exiting the shell, it is guaranteed that `tkeep` is consistent
  with `tuser_size`.  This means that `tkeep` consists of all 1s when `tvalid`
  is asserted and `tlast` is de-asserted and shows a bit-mask for the valid
  bytes in the beat when both `tvalid` and `tlast` are asserted.
- For packets entering the shell, `tkeep` can be optionally set to all 1s
  regardless of the value of `tuser_size`.  This allows user plugins to drop
  `tkeep` in their implementation.  If `tkeep` is not set to all 1s, it must be
  consistent with `tuser_size`.
  
For `tuser_src` and `tuser_dst`, they have the following format.  For packets
exiting the shell, `tuser_src` is marked accordingly and `tuser_dst` is all 0s.

    ----------------------------------------------------
    | 15                         6 |    4 |          0 |
    |------------------------------|------|------------|
    | P  P  P  P  P  P  P  P  P  P | R  R | F  F  F  F |
    |------------------------------|------|------------|
    |            MAC ports         | Rsvd |  PCIe PFs  |
    ----------------------------------------------------

The 322MHz interface is more restrictive due to requirements from CMAC IP.  It
has the following signals.

- `tvalid`, 1 bit: no de-assertion in the middle of a packet.  In other words,
  once `tvalid` is asserted to indicate the start of packet, it must remain
  asserted until `tlast`.
- `tdata`, 512 bits: same as in the 250MHz interface.
- `tkeep`, 64 bits: same as in the 250MHz interface.
- `tlast`, 1 bit: same as in the 250MHz interface.
- `tuser_err`, 1 bit: indicates if the packet contains an error.
- `tready`, 1 bit: same as in the 250MHz interface.  But packets entering the
  shell, i.e., from the RX side of CMAC IPs, the `tready` signal is not present
  and the master side assumes that `tready` is always asserted.

## Behavioral simulation

Currently, cocotb (https://www.cocotb.org/) and modelsim (https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/) are used for simulation. cocotb allows writing testbenches in python.

- Quick tutorial on modelsim: https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~jhoe/doku/doku.php?id=a_short_intro_to_modelsim_verilog_simulator
- Reference testbenches using cocotb: https://github.com/alexforencich/verilog-axis/blob/master/tb/axis_switch/test_axis_switch.py

### Building for simulation
Example command:
```
vivado -mode tcl -source ./build.tcl -tclargs \
  -board au280 \
  -num_cmac_port 2 -num_phys_func 2 \
  -sim 1 \
  -sim_lib_path $HOME/opt/xilinx_sim_libs/Vivado2021.2/compile_simlib \
  -sim_exec_path $HOME/opt/modelsim/modelsim-se_2020.1/modeltech/linux_x86_64 \
  -sim_top p2p_250mhz
```
- `sim 1` builds simulation sources.
- `sim_lib_path` specifies libraries used by Xilinx IPs.
- If the directory pointed by `sim_lib_path` is empty, the build script will compile and install the sim libraries. This step is one time and can take ~hours. This simulation libraries are global and can be shared across projects.
 - `sim_exec_path` is path to modelsim installation (i.e., the directory containing the vsim executable).

This command will create simulation sources in `build/<board>_<tag>/open_nic_shell/open_nic_shell.sim/sim_1/behav/modelsim`. These sources can be used to test any module instantiated within `sim_top`.

### Running simulation

```
cd build/<board>_<tag>/open_nic_shell/open_nic_shell.sim/sim_1/behav/modelsim

# Symlink helper scripts
ln -s <path-to>/open-nic-shell/script/tb/* ./
# Example:
ln -s ../../../../../../../script/tb/* ./

# Symlink the test bench files
ln -s <path-to>/open-nic-shell/plugin/p2p/box_250mhz/tb/<module-to-test>/* ./
# Example:
ln -s ../../../../../../../plugin/p2p/box_250mhz/tb/* ./

# Compile the simulation sources using modelsim
./compile.sh  # (This script is autogenerated during building step by Vivado)

# Run the simulation
DUT=<module-to-test> GUI=0 DEBUG=0 ./run.sh  # run.sh is linked from the script/tb directory
# Example
DUT=p2p_250mhz_wrapper ./run.sh
## Set GUI=1 to see waveform
```
Note, in the above example, the top level module specified to Vivado was `p2p_250mhz`, while the top module being simulated is `p2p_250mhz_wrapper`. This can be done since we also copied `p2p_250mhz_wrapper.sv`. In general any module that is included in the top module specified to Vivado can be simulated with the exported sources.

### How the simulation works
#### Simulation setup
Open nic shell uses Xilinx IPs, these cannot be directly simulated by third party simulators. Third party simulators require Vivado to compile simulation libraries.

For any project, Vivado can output simulation sources for a set of supported simulators. Vivado will understand the dependencies in the project and created sources for simulating a specified top level module.

These sources are then compiled by the simulator (modelsim in this case). The run file executes modelsim and also tells it to use cocotb (using the pli flag), cocotb knows the test bench file using the exported env variables in run.sh file. (See https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/custom_flows.html for reference on how to tell modelsim that cocotb is being used).

#### Simulation execution
The python test bench executes python code until it reaches a point where it needs simulation of the verilog design, at that point modelsim takes over until some signals need to be set by the python test bench and this process continues.

Note: There is no fundamental restriction to use above tools. One can write a testbench in verilog to simulate parts of open nic shell using Vivado simulator (https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug900-vivado-logic-simulation).

## Programming FPGA

After bitstream generation, FPGA can be programming in two ways.

1. Program the device directly.  The FPGA configuration will lose after reboot.
2. Program and boot from the configuration memory.

Because the shell bitstream contains a PCI-e IP core, both approaches will cause
the lost of PCI-e link.  It could be fatal depending on the model of host
motherboards.  For example, for Dell servers, losing discovered PCI-e links
could lead to a forced reboot triggered by iDRAC.

To avoid this, use the Bash script `script/setup_device.sh`, which disables the
reporting of fatal errors to PCI-e root complex before programming and triggers
a PCI-e link re-scan after programming.  The script takes the device BDF (i.e.,
`BB:DD.FF` without the domain, which usually is `0000`) as the single input, and
should be ran on the server with the FPGA card.

There are two limitations related to the script.  First, if an FPGA is not yet
programmed with a PCI-e enabled bitstream, it would not have an BDF address.  In
this case, the script does not work.  The second case is when OpenNIC driver is
already loaded, it can hang the kernel after the script issues link re-scan.
This issue is planned to be addressed in the future driver release.

For the above two cases, the safest workaround is to use a different server to
program the FPGA.  For configuration memory programming, do a cold reboot to
trigger the FPGA boot process.

For the "Program the device directly" way, consider using/referring to
`script/program_fpga.sh`. Note, if this is the first time programming FPGA with
the bitstream then the server needs to be warm rebooted. No reboot is required
for later programming (unless a cold reboot is issued).

## Known Issues

### Server Boot Failure after FPGA Programming

A warm reboot is needed after loading the bitstream onto the FPGA.  But this
reboot fails with the error message: 

    A PCIe link training failure is observed in Slot1 and the link is disabled.

For Dell servers, there is a temporary hack [discussed
here](https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/PCIe-and-CPM/PCIE-link-training-error-on-DELL-R730/m-p/806428).
The trick is to issue a second warm reboot command using iDRAC while the system
is rebooting and before PCIe endpoint detection.  The hypothesis is that this
gives enough time to load the configuration on the FPGA.  This seems to be
working so far.

### CMAC license

Some users have reported this error when trying to build the shell.

    ERROR: [Common 17-69] Command failed: This design contains one or more cells
    for which bitstream generation is not permitted:
    `cmac_subsystem_inst/cmac_wrapper_inst/cmac_inst/inst/i_cmac_usplus_0_top
    (<encrypted cellview>)`.  If a new IP Core license was added, in order for
    the new license to be picked up, the current netlist needs to be updated by
    resetting and re-generating the IP output products before bitstream
    generation.

Since CMAC is hardened in Ultrascale+, `cmac_usplus` has a free license.  To get
the CMAC license, go to [www.xilinx.com/getlicense](https://www.xilinx.com/getlicense).
After login, click "Search Now" in the "Evaluation and No Charge Cores" box on
the right side of the page.  You will see a popup with a "Search" box at top
left.  Enter "100G" in the search box.  You will see "UltraScale+ Integrated
100G Ethernet No Charge License".  Select this and click "Add". Then you'll be
able to find it in the "Certificate Based Licenses" table. Select it and click
"Generate Node-Locked License". A screenshot could be found ![here](vivado_cmac.png).
